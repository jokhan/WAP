First of all, I would like to thank for this giving me opportunity in front of you.
Sir/mam, my name is Xu..., you can call me jokhan, it’s my english name, born in 1995. I’m from Wuhan University of Technology, shool of computer science and technology and my major is software engineering. I chose here because I like anime, you know, Naruto, One Piece, so I wanna have a chance to go Tokyo. And more important, I wanna be a software engineer.
